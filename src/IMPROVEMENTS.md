## Things that would make this project better

## code style
- adding scss
- adding eslint

## UX
- fixing styling of cats grid (some cats have more space between them than others)- improved colors
- back to top functionality
- remembering the user's favorites (not wiping them when we click view more)
- mobile view
- improve favoriting so users can see the cat(s) they've already favorited (possibly a heart overlay)
- make "show me one cat" not destroy the rest of the cats (maybe display just the one cat but then have previous and next buttons)

## improve loading of additonial cats
- lazy load more cats or call more cats as we scroll instead of requiring user to click "view more"
- keeping a growing list of cats
- iterating over pages from the API instead of just calling for 25 every time.
-- also possibly as we iterate over pages, ensuring uniqueness of cat pictures and facts
